# Student Performance Predictor

Overview of the Project

The **Student Performance Predictor** is a simple python project for the AI and ML subject.
It uses a basic **Machine Learning model(Logistic Regression)** to predict whether a student is likely to **pass** or **fail** an exam.

The prediction is based on :
Study hours per day
Attendance percentage

A very small dataset is defined directly inside the code, so no csv files are needed.

Features

Takes **user input** for :
      study hours per day
      attendance percentage
Uses a **Logistic Regression** model to predict:
      'pass' (1) or 'fail' (0)
Simple **command-line interface**(runs in terminal)
Good example of a **basic supervised learning classification** problem.

Technologies used

**programming language:** python
**github**

Steps to Install and run the project 

1.**Install Python**
2.Install scikit-learn
3.Save the project file
4.Run the project

Instructions for Testing

1. Run the program:
2. Enter different values when asked,for example:
   study_hours = 1,attendance=60 (likely FAIL)
   study_hours = 4,attendance=90 (likely PASS)
3. Try multiple combinations of inputs to see how the prediction changes.
