Student Performance Predictor

Problem Statement 
Students often do not know if their current study effort is enough to pass an exam.
This project aims to create a simple **rule-based program** that predicts whether a student will **pass ** or **fail** based on study hours and attendance.

Scope of the Project 
The project is limited to **two input factors**.
 **study hours per day** and **attendance(%)**.
Uses **if-else conditions ** to decide the prediction.
Runs as a simple command-line python program.

Target Users 
**students** - to get a rough idea of their expected performance.
**Teachers/faculty ** - to demonstrate basic AI and ML concepts.
**Beginners in AI and ML** - as a small,easy example of classification.

High-Level-Features
Takes user input: study hours and attendance.
Predicts **Pass** or **Fail** using if-else conditions.
Simple python implementation with minimal code.
