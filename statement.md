Student Performance Predictor

Problem Statement 
Students often do not know if their current study effort is enough to pass an exam.
This project uses a simple machine learning model to predict whether a student will **pass ** or **fail** based on study hours and attendance.

Scope of the Project 
Uses a very small sample dataset defined inside the code.
Considers only two input : **study hours per day** and **attendance(%)**.
Uses **Logistic Regression ** for basic binary classification(pass/fail).
Runs as a simple command-line python program.

Target Users 
**students** - to get a rough idea of their expected performance.
**Teachers/faculty ** - to demonstrate basic AI and ML concepts.
**Beginners in AI and ML** - as a small,easy example of classification.

High-Level-Features
Takes user input: study hours and attendance.
Predicts **Pass** or **Fail** using a trained ML model.
Simple python implementation with minimal code.
No CSV or external files required.
